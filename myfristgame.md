# Dodge and Hit game #

**What am I investigating?**
This game is about dodging the enemy his weapon and pulling yours in the direction of your enemy. I'm investigating how to pull objects to a changing X,Y position of the player. 

**what inspired you?**
To improve the way I think when programming and using some math to fix the problems I had making this game. It's also my fist two player game I have made!

**Social context**
Fun, fast hit and kill game. Be better then your friend and rub it in their face.


**How do you play?**
the game is made to use the arrow key's and "w,s,d,a". These are the key to move your character. When you are moving to far away from your weapon it will pull to you. You can use this to pull your weapon to the other player. When you get hit by the weapon of the other player you, the player that hit you scored a point. The game ends after 5 points.
