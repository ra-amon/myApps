# Dart #

This is a little game with 2 infra-red sensors. The first idea was to make a dart game with it using these sensors, but the sensors are not very accurate so I had to change my plan.

I still wanted to make something fun with these sensors because they give the feeling that they are doing something magic. 

The game is about freeing the red balls out of the cage using your hands and the sensors to move the first ball. The more you free the bigger your swarm of balls, but the cage gets smaller.

Do this in a record time and show how good you are at controlling the infra-red sensor!
